### Pricing Sweet Spots by Category

- **Nutrition**: $5-8/month ($50-100/year) - Cal AI overpriced, creating opportunity  
- **Fitness**: $3-7/month ($25-80/year) - Wide range, free tiers common
- **Meetings**: $8-18/month ($100-200/year) - B2B premium acceptable

### Key Market Insights

1. **Longer trials work for habit-forming apps** (YNAB's 34 days)
2. **Fitness apps typically offer generous free tiers** to build user base
3. **Meeting apps can charge B2B premiums** but need clear ROI
4. **Hidden pricing creates user frustration** (Cal AI backlash)
5. **Student discounts are standard** (20% typical)

## 2. Our Pricing Philosophy

### "Earn Trust First" Approach

Given **zero brand recognition** and expected **early bugs**, our strategy prioritizes:

1. **Generous free tiers** that provide genuine value
2. **Transparent pricing** - no hidden costs or variable pricing
3. **Extended trials** to overcome trust barriers
4. **Patient conversion** - let the product earn upgrades
5. **Data-driven optimization** based on usage patterns

### AI Cost Considerations

Our AI features differentiate us but affect margins:
- **LLM costs**: ~$0.20-0.50 per user per month (estimated)
- **Processing costs**: Image analysis, auto-categorization
- **Scaling considerations**: Costs decrease with volume

**Margin Targets**:
- Free tier: Break-even on infrastructure only
- Pro tier: 70%+ gross margin after AI costs
- Bundle: 75%+ gross margin with cross-subsidization

## 8. Anti-Churn Strategy

### Building the Moat
What makes users stick beyond just features:

#### Data Lock-In (Ethical)
- **Rich historical data**: Years of workouts, meals, meetings, spending
- **AI-learned preferences**: Personalized recommendations improve over time
- **Progress milestones**: Achievement history and streaks
- **Data export always available** - but AI context and insights aren't portable

#### Habit Integration
- **Daily touchpoints**: Morning nutrition planning, post-workout analysis
- **Streak mechanics**: Workout streaks, consistent budgeting rewards
- **Social accountability**: Community features, shared goals
- **Calendar integration**: Becomes part of daily workflow

#### Continuous Value Growth
- **AI gets smarter**: More personalized over time
- **Network effects**: Community value increases with users
- **Feature velocity**: Regular updates and improvements
- **Seasonal relevance**: New Year goals, summer fitness, holiday budgeting

### Cancellation Flow
**When users try to cancel:**

1. **Understanding**: "Help us improve - why are you canceling?"
2. **Value reminder**: Show their progress, streaks, achievements
3. **Alternative offers**:
   - Pause subscription for 3 months
   - Downgrade to different tier
   - 50% discount for 3 months
   - Keep data but lose AI features
4. **Genuine support**: "Let us help solve the problem"
5. **Graceful exit**: "Your data will be here when you return"

### Save Offers
**Tier-Based Retention:**
- **New subscribers** (< 3 months): 50% off next 3 months
- **Established users** (3-12 months): 3-month pause option
- **Long-term users** (12+ months): Lifetime 30% discount

**Problem-Specific Offers:**
- "Too expensive": Show ROI calculation, offer 6-month payment plan
